Theos was initially “iphone-framework”, a project created to simplify building code at the command line for iOS devices (primarily jailbroken devices). It later underwent significant changes and became Theos, a flexible [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)-based build system primarily for jailbreak software development, but also with complete support for building for other supported platforms. Theos runs on, and can build projects for, macOS, iOS, Linux, and Windows (under [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) or [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about)).

In 2015, the project stalled as Dustin Howett was unable to devote time to it. Since then, it has been taken up by [the community](https://github.com/theos/theos/graphs/contributors) who have added a host of desired features and fixed a multitude of issues. The legacy version of Theos that used to be located at DHowett/theos is permanently preserved on the [legacy](https://github.com/theos/theos/tree/legacy) branch.

There is also documentation available for the original Theos at the [iPhone Dev Wiki](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos) and [theos-ref](https://github.com/theiostream/theos-ref). Please note, however, that not all information is up-to-date and may not reflect recent changes to Theos.
